# HackatonXAI
Welcome to hackatonXAI repo! Here a guide how we are going to use the files to make more sense out of Shap and Lime and see what the pros and cons are!

## Planning
You are going to work on either Shap or Lime. There is a guide file for Shap and Lime. 

You may download the one you need and get started!

Once you have downloaded the file you can go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/) and open the file you just downloaded in the "upload" tab.

You can run every cell and see how Shap or Lime explain on different models.



## Goals

* Try out datasets you may know on Shap or Lime
* Write down for yourself in the notebook how easy you find it to work with Shap or Lime
   * Are the visualizations clear?
   * Is the documentation helpful?
   * What are problems you run into (bugs/errors)
   * What would make Shap or Lime better?
